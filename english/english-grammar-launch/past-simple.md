## Past simple

It just means something that is finished, over, in the past.

I/he/she/it/we/you/they + past tense verb.

>> I visited the zoo yesterday.
>
>> He ran really quickly.
>
>> They bought a new car.

I/he/she/you etc. + didn't + basic verb
So '**didn't**' indicates the past tense.

> I didn't visit Paul yesterday because he was sick.

Did + the subject I/he/she/they etc. + basic verb

> Did I perform well on stage?

In English, many past simple verbs end in 'ed'. (stopped, jumped, visited, etc.) These are **regular** verbs.
Other verbs in English are **irregular** and their past tense form is different (drove, went, heard, etc.)

> The party lasted 10 hours. We got home at around 3 am and slept straight away.

For the verb 'be', which is 'am', 'is' and 'are'. The past simple tense is formed with 'was' or 'were'.

>> I was born in 1985.
>
>> Lee and Fiona were at the party last night.
