## Going to

* Meaning one is something that I planned, I arranged myself
* Meaning two is something that's just happening elsewhere, but based on some evidence, based on something that I can see, I guess something is going to happen in the future.

I + am + going to + basic verb (like walk, see, visit, go etc.)
He/she/it + is + going to + basic verb
We/you/they + are + going to + basic verb
> She **is going to study** hard to become a doctor.

I + am + not + going to + basic verb (like walk, see, visit, go etc.)
he/she/it + is + not + going to + basic verb
We/you/they + are + not + going to + basic verb
> We **aren't going to see** dad this week because he's on a business trip.

Is + he/she/it + going to + a basic verb
And we use are for we/you/they + going to + a basic verb
> **Are** you **going to tidy** your room soon? I asked you twice already.

Note that we often contract the subject and the verb **to be** (am, is, are):

* I am going to = I'm going to
* He/she/it is going to = he's/she's/it's going to
* We/you/they are going to = we're/you're/they're going to

* I am **not** going to = I'm not going to
* He/she/it is **not** going to = he's not or he isn't/she's not or she isn't/it's not or it isn't going to
* We/you/they are **not** going to = we're not or we aren't/you're not or you aren't/they're not or they aren't going to
