## Verb + -ing

Verbs which use an -ing verb form after them.

I/he/she/it etc. + **enjoy** + -ing verb form (walking, visiting etc.)
* **enjoy**
* **love**
* **hate**
* **stop**
* **avoid**
* **imagine**
* **consider**
* **spend time**
* **practise**
* **finish**

> Whenever I'm angry,I **imagine** walking along a beautiful beach. my anger quickly disappears.

I/he/she/it etc. + verb from list + not + -ing verb form

> The summer holidays are here! I enjoy not waking up early every day.

question word + I/he/she/it etc. + verb from list + -ing verb form

> Do you enjoy eating out?

> I **enjoy watching** romance movies and action movies.
> I **enjoy** romance movies and action movies.

The meaning of these two sentences is very similar, but the first is emphasizing that you enjoy **watching** these movies

The tense of the verbs can change, but the -ing form must still be used after.

> I loved eating chocolate when I was a child.

> I love eating new cuisine from around the world.

> She loves eating at expensive restaurants.

the verb + -ing structure is different to the present continuous (be + -ing):
verb + -ing: I enjoy travelling around France (generally, I like travelling around France).
present continuous: I am travelling around France (I am travelling around France now).

be + -ing + verb + -ing

> My friend Barry is considering moving to Australia. He has always wanted to live there.

## Both, neither and either

Talk about two things or people.

both/neither/either + noun

> **Both** books are really interesting. I highly recommend them.
> **Neither** book is boring.
> You can borrow **either** book.

both of/neither of/either of + the/pronoun/possessive (them, these, my, us, you, your, Alan's, Mary's etc.)

> When I visited Spain, I stayed with a Spanish couple. But **neither** of them spoke English, so it was very difficult to communicate.

both... + and...

>It's **both** hot **and** humid here in France. I am constantly using the air conditioner.

neither... + nor...

> The strange man we met today really scared me. He **neither** said anything **nor** smiled.

either... + or...

> We can **either** go swimming **or** ice skating. Which do you prefer?

When you use both of you can also simply use both:

> **Both of** the smartphones are using the latest technology.
> **Both** the smartphones are using the latest technology

You can use both, neither and either alone if your intended meaning is clear:

>> Dad: 'Do you want a chocolate bar or an ice cream?'
>> Child: '**Both.**' (= I want both of them)
>
>> Jill: 'Will you have a glass if wine or a beer?'
>> Henry: '**Neither**. I'm driving so I'll just have a glass of juice, thanks.' (= I want neither of them)
>
>> Tom: 'I'm booking the hotel for our trip. Which one shall we stay at? This one or this one?'
>> Carol: '**Either**. I really don't mind.' (= Either of them is fine)

Either is positive and neither is negative. We can use a negative word with either to mean neither:

> I was invited to two weddings. But I **couldn't** go to **either** of them.
> I was invited to two weddings. But I could go to **neither** of them.

These sentences mean the same thing: I couldn't go to any of the two weddings.
