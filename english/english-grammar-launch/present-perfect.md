## Present perfect

We use it to talk about things that happened in the past up until this point in our life. Think of the **present perfect** as in **my life up to now**.

We can use many time words with the present perfect.
**today**, **this week**, **this year**, **this morning** etc.

When we use them, we always mean that the time period is continuing now and will continue in the future. You can think of it like the phrase '**so far**' or '**up to now**'. The time period we're talking about hasn't finished, it's continuing.
