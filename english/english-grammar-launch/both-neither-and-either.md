## Both, neither and either

Talk about two things or people.

both/neither/either + noun
> **Both** books are really interesting. I highly recommend them.
> **Neither** book is boring.
> You can borrow **either** book.

both of/neither of/either of + the/pronoun/possessive (them, these, my, us, you, your, Alan's, Mary's etc.)
> When I visited Spain, I stayed with a Spanish couple. But **neither** of them spoke English, so it was very difficult to communicate.

both... + and...
> It's **both** hot **and** humid here in France. I am constantly using the air conditioner.

neither... + nor...
> The strange man we met today really scared me. He **neither** said anything **nor** smiled.

either... + or...
> We can **either** go swimming **or** ice skating. Which do you prefer?

When you use both of you can also simply use both:
> **Both of** the smartphones are using the latest technology.
> **Both** the smartphones are using the latest technology

You can use both, neither and either alone if your intended meaning is clear:
> Dad: 'Do you want a chocolate bar or an ice cream?'
> Child: '**Both.**' (= I want both of them)

> Jill: 'Will you have a glass if wine or a beer?'
> Henry: '**Neither**. I'm driving so I'll just have a glass of juice, thanks.' (= I want neither of them)

> Tom: 'I'm booking the hotel for our trip. Which one shall we stay at? This one or this one?'
> Carol: '**Either**. I really don't mind.' (= Either of them is fine)

Either is positive and neither is negative. We can use a negative word with either to mean neither:
> I was invited to two weddings. But I **couldn't** go to **either** of them.
> I was invited to two weddings. But I could go to **neither** of them.

These sentences mean the same thing: I couldn't go to any of the two weddings.
