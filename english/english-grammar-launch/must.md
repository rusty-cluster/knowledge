## Must

So when we say **must**, there are two meanings:

The first one means something similar to **have to**. It's an imperative.
> You *have to* finish your homework.

The second means. You **believe** something is true or certain. You could be wrong, but you believe it to be true.
It doesn't mean *you have to do something*, it means *I think, I guess this is true based on some evidence that I can see*.
So all these things are really guesses.
> Paul works from 8am until 10pm - 14 hours a day! He **must get** so tired.

### I/he/she/it/we/you/they + must + be + adjective
> You **must be hungry**. Let me make you a sandwich.

### I/he/she/it etc. + must + be + -ing verb.
> Look, there's John driving his car. He **must be going** to work.

### I/he/she/it etc. + must + basic verb.
> You are from England? You **must drink** lots of tea.

If we want to talk about the past, we use this structure:
### I/he/she/it etc. + must + have + been + adjective.
> John **must have been asleep** when I called him. He sounded very tired.

### I/he/she/it etc. + must + have + been + -ing verb.
> I **must have been sleeping** when you knocked on the door because I didn't hear it.

### I/he/she/it etc. + must + have + past participle verb (gone, eaten, known etc.)
> I feel so sick. I **must have eaten** something bad yesterday.

Just remember, the present form we use **must**, the past form we use **must have**.

Don't confuse this meaning of **must** with the other meaning. Notice the difference:
> You worked so hard today. You **must be** really tired. = **I believe** that this is true.
> You worked so hard today. You **must take** a rest right now. = You **have to** do this.

We can contract the past structure like this:
**Must have** = **must've**
> I lost my scarf today. I **must've** have left it on the bus.
