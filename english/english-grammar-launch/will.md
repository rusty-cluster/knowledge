## Will

We use **will** when we make an instant decision based on new information.

I/he/she/it/we/you/they etc. + will + basic verb (walk, see, visit, go etc.)
> Your luggage looks very heavy. **I'll help** you.

I/he/she/it etc. + will + not + basic verb
> I told Paul to visit the doctor, but he **won't (will not) listen** to me.

Will + I/he/she/it etc. + basic verb
> **Will** you **help** me carry this sofa please?

We usually contract **will not** to **won't.**

We often use **I think I'll...** and **I don't think I'll** to talk about what we have just decided.
>> I'm hungry. **I think I'll order** a pizza. = I just thought of and decided to order a pizza.
>
>> We are feeling a little tired. **I don't think we'll go** to the party tonight. = We just thought about this and decided to not go to the party later.
