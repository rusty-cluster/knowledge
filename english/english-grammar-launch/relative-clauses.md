## Relative clauses

Relative clauses using '**who**' and '**what**' give extra information about a **person** or **thing**.

Person + 'who' relative clause

> The woman **who we saw** today looked very strange.

Thing + 'that' relative clause

>The red Ferrari **that we saw today** was beautiful.

Notice that it is possible to leave out the relative clause and still have a complete sentence.

>> The woman **who we saw today** looked very strange.
>
>> The woman looked very strange.

>> The red Ferrari **that was speeding down the road today** was beautiful.
>
>> The red Ferrari was beautiful.

> 'Obsolete' is a word **that means 'no longer in use' or 'outdated'.**
