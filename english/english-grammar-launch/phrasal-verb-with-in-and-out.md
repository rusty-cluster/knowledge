These are thousands of **phrasal verbs** in English, some more common than others.

Some **phrasal verbs** in English are very logical and easy to understand (**stand up**, **sit down**). But some are more difficult to understand without knowing the meaning (**drop out** and **figure out**).

A **phrasal verb** can also be followed by another preposition depending on the following noun (**sit down on** the chair, **run away from** the man).

Phrasal verbs can change tense just like other verbs. You only need to change the first part (the verb) of the **phrasal verb**.
For example **pick up**, **picking up**, **picked up**, **have picked up**.
