## So and such

The meaning of these two words is the same, they just make the following words **stronger**. This gives the meaning so much more strength and it gives it more passion and feeling.

We often use **so** and **such** with **that** to express how we feel or what we are going to do:
>> The weather is **so beautiful that** I'm going to have a picnic.
>
>> It's **such** a **rainy day that** I'm going to stay inside.

You can also leave out **that**:
>> The weather is **so beautiful** I'm going to have a picnic.
>
>> It's **such** a **rainy day** I'm going to stay inside.
