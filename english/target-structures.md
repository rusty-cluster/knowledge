question word + I/he/she/it etc. + verb from list + -ing verb form

> I **enjoy watching** romance movies and action movies.
>
> I **enjoy** romance movies and action movies.

the meaning of these two sentences is very similar, but the first is emphasizing that you enjoy **watching** these movies

## both, neither and either

talk about two things or people

*both/neither/either + noun

> **Both** books are really interesting. I highly recommend them.\
> **Neither** book is boring.\
> You can borrow **either** book.

both of/neither of/either of + the/pronoun/possessive (them, these, my, us, you, your, Alan's, Mary's etc.)

> When I visited Spain, I stayed with a Spanish couple. But **neither** of them spoke English, so it was very difficult to communicate.

both... + and...

>It's **both** hot **and** humid here in France. I am constantly using the air conditioner.

neither... + nor...

> The strange man we met today really scared me. He **neither** said anything **nor** smiled.

either... + or...

> We can **either** go swimming **or** ice skating. Which do you prefer?

when you use both of you can also simply use both:

> **Both of** the smartphones are using the latest technology.\
> **Both** the smartphones are using the latest technology

you can use both, neither and either alone if your intended meaning is clear:

>> Dad: 'Do you want a chocolate bar or an ice cream?'\
>> Child: '**Both.**' (= I want both of them)
>
>> Jill: 'Will you have a glass lf wine or a beer?'\
>> Henry: '**Neither**. I'm driving so I'll just have a glass of juice, thanks.' (= I want neither of them)
>
>> Tom: 'I'm booking the hotel for our trip. Which one shall we stay at? This one or this one?'\
>> Carol: '**Either**. I really don't mind.' (= Either of them is fine)

either is positive and neither is negative. We can use a negative word with either to mean neither:

> I was invited to two weddings. but I **couldn't** go to **either** of them.\
> I was invited to two weddings. but I could go to **neither** of them.

These sentences mean the same thing: I could't go to any of the two weddings.
